# FizzBuzz
FizzBuzz (Simple) 

Here was have a very simple FizzBuzz programme

#The task detailed below

Iterate 1-100
Any number divisible by 3 evenly - written out as Fizz
Any number divisible by 5 evenly - written out as Buzz
Any number divisible by 3 and 5 evenly - written out as FizzBuzz

We us a simple for loop to iterate 1-100 using range (up to but not including the last number, so we take it to 101)
We use the if statement to achieve this
We use modulo to look at the reaminder of the division - if the remainder is 0 it is evenly divisible and will print out the requested 
If the remainder is other than 0 then it is not evenly divisble and will print x
